:toc:
:asciidoctor-source: ./spring-batch-lightmin-documentation/src/main/asciidoc

The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ is a client-server library on top of the _Spring Batch_ and _Spring Boot_ to monitor and configure _Spring Batch Jobs_.
By enabling the _Spring Batch Lightmin_, a _BatchConfigurer_ will be registered and provides

* JobRepository
* JobOperator
* JobExplorer
* JobLauncher
* JobBuilderFactory
* StepBuilderFactory

and depending beans out of the box.

== Getting Started

=== Server

==== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-server</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Server

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminServer
public class LightminServer {


    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminServer.class, args);
    }
}
----

The code above enables the _SpringBatchLightminServer_ with default properties.

===== application.properties

[source, java]
----
server.port=8090
----

=== Client

==== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-client</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Client

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminClient
public class LightminClient {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminClient.class, args);
    }

}
----

The code above enables the _SpringBatchLightminClient_ with the default configuration.
The default configuration provides a _JdbcJobRepository_, _JdbcConfigurationRepostor_ and
needs a configured _DataSource_ with the bean name _dataSource_.

In order to register to the _SpringBatchLightminServer_, the property
_spring.batch.lightmin.server.url_ has to be set.

===== application.properties

[source, java]
----
spring.batch.lightmin.server.url=http://localhost:8090
----

=== Embedded Server

If you want to use the _SpringBatchLightmin_ in a single application context, an
embedded server mode is provided.

==== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-server</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Server

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEmbeddedSpringBatchLightminServer
public class LightminEmbeddedServer {


    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminEmbeddedServer.class, args);
    }
}
----

The code above will boostrap the _SpringBatchLightminClient_ and the
_SpringBatchLightminServer_ in an embedded mode.

=== Getting the lastest SNAPSHOTS

In order to get the latest _SNAPSHOTS_, you have to activate the sonatype snapshot repository.

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

== Spring Batch Lightmin UI

=== Applications

The start page of the _SpringBatchLightmin_ shows all register applications. The status value shows the current health status of the application.

=== Application Information

The application information view is the entry point to the monitoring and administration of a client application. The overview shows the important endpoints, all known _Spring Batch Jobs_ and configured external links of the client application.
The Menu gives the access to monitoring (Job), administration (Job Configurations) and job launcher sections.

=== Jobs

All known jobs  of the client application will be listed in the jobs tab with their current instance count.
To get more detailed informations about the job instances, you have to click on the job name, you want to view.

==== Job Instances

After selecting a job by name, all instances of the job will be listed with their current execution count. In order
to get more detailed information about the executions of the instance, select the desired job instance id.

==== Job Executions

The view will show an overview of all executions for the selected instance id. To get details of the job execution,
click on the desired id.
